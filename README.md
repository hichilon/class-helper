class-helper
============

The helper library uses [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) and other techniques to manipulates dates
so that class assignments and other listings appear to be dynamically generated when infact there are provided statically. 

**Demos** are the best way to see this concept in practice:

- [Operating Systems class - Berea College](http://cs.berea.edu/courses/os-f13/)
- [Story Telling through Animation class - Berea College](http://cs.berea.edu/courses/storytelling-f13/)
